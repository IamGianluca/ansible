Ansible is a software tool that provides simple but powerful automation for cross-platform computer support. 

In our case, we are using Ansible to create simple playbooks to rapidly set up host Operating Systems and Docker containers (e.g., installing frequently used packages, dotfiles, etc.) and to store encrypted passwords and SSH keys and secrets. The idea is to have simple playbooks we can use to quickly set up the OS, instead of wasting hours doing this manually.
